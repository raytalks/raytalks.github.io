<h2>About me</h2>

  <h3>In permanent beta: learning, improving, evolving</h3>
<p>
In a world of copy cats, it's hard to stand out and make a difference, so I learned how to hustle.
I'm obsessed with hacks, whether it's a gym hack (hustle for that muscle), a life hack (how to talk to people when you have nothing to say) or a growth hack (so _that's_ how AirBnB did it...).
</p>
<p>
In order to grow a company, the key is to create a scalable growth machine* focused on deep understanding of the customer. If you know your customer, you can work to attract more potential customers and convert them to leads, trials, signups, and ultimately ambassadors.
</p>
<p>
I started as a co-founder of a travel agency, where I built amazing development and design teams who together have increased new signups by nearly 500% and added thousands in recurring revenue.
I have gone on to startups where I was part of the growth team and learned about growth processes and strategies. I'm looking for the highest impact area and find a company's own form of data-driven decision making.
</p>
<p>
Besides working on growth, I enjoy organizing events like Amsterdam.rb and conferences like AMSxTech and TEDxAmsWomen.

  <h3>Enter codeschool</h3>
<p>
I decided to learn the basics of code so I could understand my dev team and perhaps even write something new myself. I entered a Development Bootcamp where I was taught the basics of Ruby and Rails and eventhough I had fun, all the information was a lot to digest and I still wasn't able to fully understand developer talk...because, you know, you don't learn how to code in 1 week.
<p>
  <h3>puts "Hello World!"</h3>
<p>
So, I committed to learning Ruby from scratch with Zed Shaws' "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" and found a brilliant teacher to help me through. <a href="https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/">Jeff Kreeftmeijer</a> is an engineer at AppSignal and helps me with tough Ruby issues.
I'm currently building my very first Rails app (demo of a web shop) and I built this page in plain HTML.
</p>
  <h3>Personal</h3>
<p>
Born and raised in Amsterdam, I've learned to love rainy days. Give me a book, some coffee and chocolate and I'm the happiest person alive. I like learning Ruby (programming language) and in my spare time I enjoy tinkering around a bit. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and when I'm not at home, I'm hitting the gym as much as I can.

  <h2>Career</h2>
<p><img src="images/appsignal.png" />
  <h3>AppSignal (Saas)</h3>
AppSignal had grown off the back of a great product and strong word of mouth despite having no marketing functions. So they needed to scale that growth by increasing customer acquisition.
As the Head of Growth and the first marketing hire, I was tasked with Customer Success and working in the funnel to fully understand customers and eventually help build a growth process and strategy.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Amsterdam.rb</h3>
  I'm co-organizing monthly meetups for the Ruby community in Amsterdam.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>TEDxAmsterdamWomen</h3>
TEDxAmsWomen is a global conference that provides a stage for women to inspire; it specifically focuses on the unique way in which women contribute to global change and thus helps to reshape the future.
As Head of Partnerships, I closed partnership deals with corporates who share the same mission and vision as TEDx.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Codaisseur</h3>
Codaisseur is a coding school and offers an 8-week web development academy in Amsterdam. I was their very first student and quickly became part of the team where I was tasked with content marketing, recruiting and organising various events.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Sportiek Reizen BV (Travel)</h3>
As co-founder and Marketing Director at Sportiek Reizen BV, I was tasked to build our entire go-to market from scratch. Sales and marketing budget were limited when we just started (max. â‚¬500 p/mo) and I was the only one to execute this.
As the only person focused on marketing and sales, I built the entire customer acquisition from the ground up.
As a result, the strategies I created were responsible for closing deals with thousands of (returning) customers.
