<h2>About me</h2>

<h3>In permanent beta: learning, improving, evolving</h3>
<p>
In a world of copy cats, it's hard to stand out and make a difference, so I learned how to hustle.
I'm obsessed with hacks, whether it's a gym hack (hustle for that muscle), a life hack (how to talk to people when you have nothing to say) or a growth hack (so _that's_ how AirBnB did it...).
</p>
<p>
In order to grow a company, the key is to create a scalable growth machine* focused on deep understanding of the customer. If you know your customer, you can work to attract more potential customers and convert them to leads, trials, signups, and ultimately ambassadors.
</p>
<p>
I started as a co-founder of a travel agency, where I built amazing development and design teams who together have increased new signups by nearly 500% and added thousands in recurring revenue.
I have gone on to startups where I was part of the growth team and learned about growth processes and strategies. I'm looking for the highest impact area and find a company's own form of data-driven decision making.
</p>
<p>
Besides working on growth, I enjoy organizing events like Amsterdam.rb and conferences like AMSxTech and TEDxAmsWomen.
</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>
Born and raised in Amsterdam, I've learned to love rainy days. Give me a book, some coffee and chocolate and I'm the happiest person alive. I like learning Ruby (programming language) and in my spare time I enjoy tinkering around a bit. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and when I'm not at home, I'm hitting the gym as much as I can.
</p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<p>
During my days as co-founder of Sportiek Reizen, I wrote marketing strategies, built campaigns, managed content and took care of all the traditional online marketing stuff. I loved it, but the one thing I dreaded most was contstantly bothering my dev team with questions to make continuous small changes in the code. Add tags here, embed code there.
Besides repeatedly asking my team to do stuff, I had a hard time understanding why a certain change wasn't that easy to implement.
</p>

<h3>Enter codeschool</h3>
<p>
I decided to learn the basics of code so I could understand my dev team and perhaps even write something new myself. I entered a Development Bootcamp where I was taught the basics of Ruby and Rails and eventhough I had fun, all the information was a lot to digest and I still wasn't able to fully understand developer talk...because, you know, you don't learn how to code in 1 week.
<p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>
So, I committed to learning Ruby from scratch with Zed Shaws' "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" and found a brilliant teacher to help me through. <a href="https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/">Jeff Kreeftmeijer</a> is an engineer at AppSignal and helps me with tough Ruby issues.
I'm currently building my very first Rails app (demo of a web shop) and I built this page in plain HTML.
